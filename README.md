# Object-Oriented Programming 1
This repository contains materials and exercises related to the **Object-Oriented Programming 1** course, offered in the fourth semester of Applied Computer Science at AGH University of Krakow.

## Course Overview
The course focuses on developing programming skills using C++ in an object-oriented paradigm, covering:

- Compilation process and linking.
- Key concepts and features of object-oriented programming.
- Standard Template Library (STL) and its components.
- Function and class templates.
- Operator overloading and type conversions.
- Inheritance and virtual functions.
- Advanced C++ features including right-value references, constexpr, and lambda expressions.
- Static polymorphism and metaprogramming with templates.

Laboratory exercises were conducted using **C++**, with an emphasis on practical implementation of object-oriented principles and efficiency considerations.

All programming tasks and exercises were designed to develop a deep understanding of C++ and its modern features.
